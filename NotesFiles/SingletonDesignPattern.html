1.Singleton Design Pattern  


    It is a class and one instance. This one instance will be used in everywhere in the entire
    whole application. This is singleton.


    Class: You define a class, like MyService.
    Instance: Spring creates only one object (instance) of that class.
    Usage: This one instance is shared and used everywhere in your application,
    whenever the class is needed.



    What is the Singleton Design Pattern?
        The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and 
        provides a global point of access to that instance.

        Imagine you have a school principal. There is only one principal in the school, 
        right? You don’t want multiple principals; you want just one. 
        The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of the Principal class is 
        created.


        // Principal class - Singleton


class Principal {
    // Step 1: Create a private static instance of the class
    private static Principal instance;

    // Step 2: Make the constructor private so no one else can create an instance
    private Principal() {
        System.out.println("Principal is now assigned!");
    }

    // Step 3: Provide a public static method to get the single instance of the class
    public static Principal getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            // If no instance exists, create one
            instance = new Principal();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    public void announce() {
        System.out.println("This is the principal speaking!");
    }
}

// School class to demonstrate Singleton
public class School {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Trying to get the principal instance
        Principal principal1 = Principal.getInstance();
        principal1.announce();

        // Trying to get another instance of the principal
        Principal principal2 = Principal.getInstance();
        principal2.announce();

        // Checking if both references point to the same instance
        if (principal1 == principal2) {
            System.out.println("There is only one principal!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("There are multiple principals!");
        }
    }
}


Output

Principal is now assigned!
This is the principal speaking!
This is the principal speaking!
There is only one principal!


1. Why Use static in private static Principal instance;?

    The static keyword is used to ensure that the instance variable belongs to the class
    itself and not to any particular object created from the class. This means that no matter
    how many objects or references are created from the class, there will only be
    one instance variable shared across all of them.


2.Why Use the Singleton Pattern in Real-World Applications?

Real-World Examples

    1.Database Connection

        In an application, you often need to connect to a database. 
        Creating multiple connections can be resource-intensive and slow.
        Instead, you can use a Singleton pattern to create a single database connection 
        that is reused across the entire application. 
    
        class DatabaseConnection {
            private static DatabaseConnection instance;

            private DatabaseConnection() {
                // Code to establish a connection to the database
                System.out.println("Database connection established!");
            }
            public static DatabaseConnection getInstance() {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new DatabaseConnection();
                }
                return instance;
            }
        }
    
    2.Configuration Manager

        Imagine you have a class that reads configuration settings from a file
        (like API keys, database URLs, etc.). 
        You don’t want to load the configuration file every time you need a setting. 
        Instead, you can load it once and share it using a Singleton pattern.

        class ConfigurationManager {
            private static ConfigurationManager instance;
            private String config;
            
            private ConfigurationManager() {
                // Load the configuration file
                config = "Settings loaded!";
            }
            
            public static ConfigurationManager getInstance() {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new ConfigurationManager();
                }
                return instance;
            }
        
            public String getConfig() {
                return config;
            }
        }
        
        



    Reality MySQL Database Connecting Code

        import java.sql.Connection;
        import java.sql.DriverManager;
        import java.sql.SQLException;

        public class DatabaseConnection {
            // Step 1: Create a private static instance of this class
            private static DatabaseConnection instance;

            // Step 2: Create a Connection object
            private Connection connection;

            // Database credentials
            private String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name";
            private String username = "your_username";
            private String password = "your_password";

            // Step 3: Private constructor so no other class can instantiate
            private DatabaseConnection() {
                try {
                    // Step 4: Establish the database connection
                    connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
                    System.out.println("Database connection established!");
                } catch (SQLException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                    throw new RuntimeException("Failed to establish database connection!");
                }
            }

            // Step 5: Public static method to get the single instance of the class
            public static DatabaseConnection getInstance() {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new DatabaseConnection();
                }
                return instance;
            }

            // Step 6: Provide a method to get the connection
            public Connection getConnection() {
                return connection;
            }
        }
